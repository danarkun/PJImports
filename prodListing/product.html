        Spätburgunder
        (Pinot Noir)
        2015

        12 months maturation in small used French oak barrels
        enhances the structure of the wine without influencing the
        superb ripe cherry fruit. Very fine tannins make it smooth
        and silky, thanks to the extended lees contact it shows
        roundness and creaminess. The wine displays elegance
        and finesse with a Long and lingering finish – it is fruit-
        driven with charm.<br>
        <br>
        Drink 2017 - 2022
        <br>
        <br>
        Matches perfectly with poultry, beef and pork also with soft
        cheese

        Start with a careful selection of the vineyards: Loose soils give the
        wines richness and power, whereas calcarious soils give the wines
        elegance and complexity. Let the fermentation start on its own,. A
        slow fermentation and a long contact with the lees provide
        richness and longevity. This Grauburgunder shows its class not
        only on the palate, but also on the nose: Intense aromas of stone
        fruit and yellow apple, some tropical fruit (mango) together with
        earthy notes. Mouth filling on the palate with a generous fruit,
        terroir notes and elegant herbal spicyness. Creamy and round with
        great structure, deep and complex, long and lingering multi-layered
        finish.
